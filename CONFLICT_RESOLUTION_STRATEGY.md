CMAKE CONFLICT RESOLUTION STRATEGY
====================================

## THE PROBLEM:
The main branch contains the problematic commit 3079bd1 with aggressive flags:
- MSVC: /O2 /Oi /Ot /Oy /GL + /LTCG
- GCC: -O3 -march=x86-64 -mtune=generic

We have removed these flags and implemented the configurable system from PR #154.

## EXPECTED CONFLICT:
GitHub will show a conflict in CMakeLists.txt in the CPU optimization section.

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION:

### 1. IDENTIFY CONFLICTING SECTIONS:
Look for conflict markers:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD (main branch - PROBLEMATIC version)
if (MSVC)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE} /O2 /Oi /Ot /Oy /GL")
    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE} /O2 /Oi /Ot /Oy /GL")
    set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE} /LTCG")
=======
# CPU Architecture optimization options (OUR VERSION - CORRECT)
set(HD_CPU_OPTIMIZATION "AUTO" CACHE STRING "CPU optimization target")
if (MSVC)
    if(HD_CPU_OPTIMIZATION STREQUAL "INTEL")
        set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE} /O2")
    elseif(HD_CPU_OPTIMIZATION STREQUAL "AUTO")
        cmake_host_system_information(RESULT CPU_VENDOR QUERY PROCESSOR_DESCRIPTION)
        if(CPU_VENDOR MATCHES "AMD")
            set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE} /Oi /Ot /Oy")
>>>>>>> our-branch
```

### 2. CORRECT RESOLUTION:
COMPLETELY DELETE the top section (from main) and KEEP our version with:
- HD_CPU_OPTIMIZATION cache variable
- CPU auto-detection
- Moderate flags (no /GL, no /LTCG)

### 3. PRACTICAL RESOLUTION STEPS:

#### A. GitHub Web Interface:
1. When GitHub shows the conflict, click "Resolve conflicts"
2. In the web editor, find sections with <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>
3. COMPLETELY DELETE everything between <<<<<<< HEAD and =======
4. KEEP everything between ======= and >>>>>>> 
5. DELETE the conflict markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
6. Click "Mark as resolved" then "Commit merge"

#### B. Local (if preferred):
```powershell
# If GitHub doesn't allow web resolution, resolve locally:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout from_tag_backup_bisect_final_v085_ready_for_pr
git merge main

# Edit CMakeLists.txt:
# - Delete the problematic section from main
# - Keep our HD_CPU_OPTIMIZATION system
# - Verify no <<<<<<< or >>>>>>> markers remain

git add CMakeLists.txt
git commit -m "resolve: keep our improved CPU optimization system, remove problematic flags"
git push
```

### 4. PR COMMENT MESSAGE:
When resolving the conflict, add this comment to the PR:

"**Conflict Resolution**: Resolved CMakeLists.txt conflict by keeping our improved configurable CPU optimization system (from PR #154) and removing the problematic global flags from commit 3079bd1. This preserves the performance improvements while eliminating the regression."

### 5. POST-RESOLUTION VERIFICATION:
After resolution, CMakeLists.txt must contain:
✅ HD_CPU_OPTIMIZATION cache variable
✅ CPU auto-detection with cmake_host_system_information
✅ Moderate flags (/Oi /Ot /Oy for AMD)
❌ NO /GL, NO /LTCG, NO -march=native

## IMPORTANT:
The conflict is NORMAL and EXPECTED - it's exactly why we're making this PR!
Our version is CORRECT, the main branch version is PROBLEMATIC.
