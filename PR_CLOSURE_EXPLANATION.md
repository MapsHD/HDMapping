# PR Closure Explanation for #164

## Closing this PR to create a cleaner version

I'm closing this pull request (#164) to create a new, cleaner PR with significantly fewer file changes.

### Issue Identified

The current PR shows **2,331 files changed** due to the complex merge history from integrating multiple PRs (#150-#160) with their reverts, conflicts, and merge commits. This makes the PR difficult to review and understand.

### Root Cause

The branch includes the entire commit history from:
- Multiple merge commits between different PR branches
- Revert operations to remove problematic optimization flags
- Complex integration of PRs #150 through #160
- Historical changes that are not directly related to our core improvements

### Solution

I will create a new PR that focuses only on:
1. **Windows build documentation** (Romanian, English, Polish guides)
2. **Build automation scripts** (PowerShell automation)
3. **Performance optimization fixes** (HD_CPU_OPTIMIZATION system)
4. **Repository hygiene improvements** (.gitignore updates)

### Expected Result

The new PR will have approximately **7-8 files changed** instead of 2,331, making it:
- ✅ Much easier to review
- ✅ Clearer in scope and purpose  
- ✅ Focused on the actual improvements
- ✅ Professional and maintainable

### Next Steps

1. Close this PR (#164)
2. Create a clean branch from main
3. Add only our specific improvements
4. Create new PR with clean file diff
5. Link to issue #162 for performance regression fix

Thank you for your patience while I create a more reviewable pull request.

**Technical Note**: This approach ensures that the PR diff accurately reflects only the changes we're proposing, without the noise from complex merge history.
