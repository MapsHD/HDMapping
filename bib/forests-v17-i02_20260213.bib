ABSTRACT = {Handheld personal laser scanning (PLS) systems are increasingly being tested in forest inventory as an efficient alternative to labor-intensive, time-consuming field-based methods. However, comparative evaluations across different PLS instrument classes and the influence of operator experience on estimation accuracy remain insufficiently explored. This study presents a controlled comparison of three handheld PLS instruments representing different performance and cost classes, namely professional-grade (high-end) and lower-grade (entry-level and open-source) systems, and evaluates the influence of operator experience on the accuracy of diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height estimation. Data were collected in even-aged European beech stands using consistent acquisition and processing workflows. Tree attributes were independently estimated by operators with high, medium, and low experience and validated against reference measurements obtained from diameter tape and multi-scan terrestrial laser scanning. Accuracy was assessed using mean difference (bias) and root mean square error, and the effects of instrument type and operator experience were analyzed using one-way and two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA. Results show that instrument type is the dominant factor determining estimation accuracy. The high-end system produced the most accurate DBH and tree height estimates across all operator experience levels, whereas the entry-level and open-source systems yielded acceptable DBH accuracy but consistently underestimated tree height, particularly for taller trees. Operator experience had a secondary effect, improving DBH estimates when lower-grade instruments were used, but had little influence on tree height accuracy. Significant interaction effects indicate that operator influence depends on instrument class. These findings demonstrate that PLS can support operational forest inventory when instrument capabilities align with inventory objectives. High-end systems are currently optimal when reliable tree height estimation is required, whereas lower-grade systems may provide cost-effective solutions for inventories focused primarily on DBH.},
