ABSTRACT = {The popularity of mobile laser scanning systems as a surveying tool is growing among construction contractors, architects, land surveyors, and urban planners. The user-friendliness and rapid capture of precise and complete data on places and objects make them serious competitors for traditional surveying approaches. Considering the low cost and constantly improving availability of Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), mainly handheld surveying tools, the measurement possibilities seem unlimited. We conducted a comprehensive investigation into the quality and accuracy of a point cloud generated by a recently marketed low-cost mobile surveying system, the MandEye MLS. The purpose of the study is to conduct exhaustive laboratory tests to determine the actual metrological characteristics of the device. The test facility was the surveying laboratory of the University of Agriculture in Kraków. The results of the MLS measurements (dynamic and static) were juxtaposed with a reference base, a geometric system of reference points in the laboratory, and in relation to a reference point cloud from a higher-class laser scanner: Leica ScanStation P40 TLS. The Authors verified the geometry of the point cloud, technical parameters, and data structure, as well as whether it can be used for surveying and mapping objects by assessing the point cloud density, noise and measurement errors, and detectability of objects in the cloud.},
