\chapter{Questions from end users}

\textbf{Do you have recommendations on how to best record data?} \\
I recommend stop/scan mode for most accurate mapping.
Continuous mapping is for increase the time of the survey.  \\
\textbf{How much distance can be between two consecutive start/stop acquisitions?}\\
I suggest not more than 10 meters.\\
\textbf{Do they need to overlap? To which degree?}\\
Stop/scans should be overlapped at least 50\%.\\
\textbf{Continuous scanning: can the sensor change its tilt/angle during the recording phase? 
Or does it assume being in a upright position all the time?} \\
I suggest that MANDEYE  is somehow a upright position all the time. \\
\textbf{How “fast” am I allowed to move (I actually did a rather slow walk).} \\
I was tested it up to 10 km/h\\
\textbf{Can the sensor change height while recording?}\\
Yes.
